DillPickle is a slim Gherkin-compliant BDD story runner for .NET.

It has borrowed (or stolen?) most of its functionality from NBehave, but added the hooks I needed and some more stuff.

More info coming soon at http://mookid.dk/oncode/dillpickle

One day, maybe I'll tweet something as well... [@mookid8000][2]
